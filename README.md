## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JSON

### What I learned

During this project, I was able to acquire new skills by working with the JSON format. I also learned the importance of accessibility to ensure that our site is accessible to as many users as possible.

To work with JSON data, I used JS's async function to call the fetch and await methods, as in the following sample code:

```js
async function getData() {
  const response = await fetch('../data.json');
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
}
getData();
```

Also, I discovered how to simulate an event and use it effectively in my code.

```js
element.dispatchEvent(new Event('event'));
```

Regarding the design of the site, I learned to use the prefix **_-webkit_**

```css
selector {
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(50px);
}
```

to make the property

```css
selector {
  backdrop-filter: blur(50px);
}
```

available to iPhone users.
This project allowed me to strengthen my skills and continue to improve my knowledge in these key areas.

### Continued development

In my future projects, I want to continue to focus on working with the JSON format. Although I have worked with datasets before, I want to sharpen my skills and start working with APIs. Additionally, I discovered how to simulate an event and use it effectively, and I plan to continue to perfect this technique as well.

### Useful resources

- [element.dispatchEvent on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/dispatchEvent) - It helped me to simulate a client side event, and thus take advantage of it.

I would like to express my gratitude to my fellow learner at Kadea, [Junior Asosa](https://github.com/BlackJr-Git/), who gave me invaluable help, in particular by testing the accessibility of the site on his iPhone.
